# masterWorker
This repo contains a master and worker program. Master issue computation work to worker program and they together calculate sum of a series.
There are many test modules included in the repo for testing each part of code independently.
The final master program is masterV2.c and worker is worker.c.

Series to computed is: e^x = 1+ x + (x^2)/2! + (x^3)/3! + .........................

Usage: ./masterV2 --worker_path ./worker --num_workers [validNumber] --wait_mechanism MECHANISM -x [ValueOfX] -n [ValueOfN].
Note : It has been taken care that the max number of workers doesn't the specified number by --num_workers option.
MECHANISM which can be use are-
  1. sequential
  2. select
  3. poll
  4. epoll
